    	Tough as nails, you are not afraid of anything. It is easy for you to make enemies due to your sheer wildness. You hate to be beat at anything, and can face humiliation in a test of physical strength if you donâ€™t pump that iron enough.

		Ares is the god of war, associated with any kind of battle or violence. He is the son of Zeus and his wife Hera. Because of his cruel nature and absent moral compass, he was disliked by everyone. On the battlefield he was always accompanied by Deimos (terror) and Phobos (fear). A married Aphrodite became his lover, and they had eight children. He stood like a giant and was louder and faster than all the other gods.
