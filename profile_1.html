    	You are Aphrodite, Goddess of Love. You love to love and are often a victim of your own emotions. Armed with a natural self-confidence, you always have to look your best whatever the situation. People are naturally attracted to you, and you never need to look far to find an admirer.

		Aphrodite is the goddess of love, beauty, and desire. She was born when the father of the gods Uranus was castrated by his son Cronus, who threw his parts into the sea. They began to foam and out of it came Aphrodite. She married Hephaestuts, the god of metalwork, who made her a magical girdle. When she wore this girdle, no one could resist her. She took many lovers and was loved and adored by many.
