		Dionysus is the god of wine and fertility, also a patron of the arts. The son of Zeus and Semele, he was the only god with a mortal parent. He represents the duality of life, reflected in the idea of wine, which can give pleasure but also cause pain. He was one of the most important gods in everyday life, and was not only worshipped but his presence felt within his followers. A festival devoted to him was held in the spring when vines started growing leaves and most Greek plays were written to be performed during this time.
