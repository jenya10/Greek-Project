    	You probably love the beach or anything aquatic related. Always second best, you strive to be number 1 in all aspects of your life. You are prone to mood swings though, and while youâ€™re usually calm and collected, you can become enraged and violent in an instant.

		Poseidon is the god of the sea and protector of everything aquatic. His parents are Cronus and Rhea, and he is one of six siblings who divided the power of the world. His brother Zeus got the sky, Hades got the underworld, he got the sea. He carried a trident and could make the earth shake or shatter any objects. He is said to have created the very first horse in order to impress the goddess Demeter. Men would then drown horses as a sacrifice in his honor, particularly to ensure sailors a safe voyage at sea. Second only in power to his brother Zeus, he had a very moody personality and tended to pick fights with other gods.
